# Exploring and Analyzing Linguistic Differences between Human-generated and AI-generated Texts

Welcome to the repository for my data analysis on differences between human-generated and ChatGPT-generated texts! In this project, I dive deep into the topic to explore, analyze, and derive insights using various linguistic complexity measures. I leverage a rich dataset specifically curated for this project.

## Repository Structure

- `Code/`: Includes the Colab notebooks showcasing the process of deriving the datasets and data analysis process
- `Data/`: Contains output files from the data analysis

## GPT-wiki-intro-features datasets

As part of this project, two datasets were created:
- [julia-lukasiewicz-pater/small-GPT-wiki-intro-features](https://huggingface.co/datasets/julia-lukasiewicz-pater/small-GPT-wiki-intro-features) 
- [julia-lukasiewicz-pater/GPT-wiki-intro-features](https://huggingface.co/datasets/julia-lukasiewicz-pater/GPT-wiki-intro-features)

 Those datasets are based on [aadityaubhat/GPT-wiki-intro](https://huggingface.co/datasets/aadityaubhat/GPT-wiki-intro).
 The full version contains 300k texts (150k from Wikipedia and 150k generated by ChatGPT).
 The smaller version contains 100k randomly selected texts (50k from Wikipedia and 50k generated by ChatGPT).
 For each text, various complexity measures were calculated, including e.g. readibility, lexical richness etc.
 It can be used for text classification or analysis of linguistic features of human-generated and ChatGPT-generated texts.
 


## Datasets structure

Features were calculated using various Python libraries, i.e. NLTK, [readability-metrics](https://pypi.org/project/py-readability-metrics/), [lexical-diversity](https://pypi.org/project/lexical-diversity/),
and [TextDescriptives](https://hlasse.github.io/TextDescriptives/). The list of all features and their corresponding sources can be found below:
